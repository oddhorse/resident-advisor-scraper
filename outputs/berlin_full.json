Every shade and subgenre of electronic music has its place here, from fast, groovy techno to uplifting house music, from chugging EBM to frenetic breakbeat stompers.\n\n☐ ☐ ☐ ☐ ☐ ☐ ☐ ☐ ☐ ☐ ☐ ☐ ☐ ☐ ☐ ☐\n\nTickets are available at the door. RA ticket does not guarantee entry; purchased tickets will be refunded in that case.\n\nPlease note we are fully cashless, we ONLY accept CARD and BITCOIN payments at the club.\n\nRenate should be a safe space for any ethnicity, gender or sexual orientation.

    "information": "// some tickets are available at the door, subject to capacity.\n\nCome early, stay forever!\n\nGlide into 2025 and celebrate new beginnings and good riddance!\n\nBask in the dawn of the new year through immersive techno, soulful house, and that signature OXI touch. We've got a divine mix of very special guests and the finest local talent. \nIf our heated garden is not enough for you to wind down, we've got a tranquil Ambient Floor, a tasty Chili Soup Bar and a toasty Glühwein on tap!\n\nRing in the new year at OXI’s 36-hour marathon, a boundary-pushing celebration catering to the city’s vibrant creative community. From the UK’s Yazzus—renowned for her high-octane rave aesthetics, breakbeats, and forward-thinking club sounds—to the experimental selections of SPFDJ and Spekki Webu, who each channel hypnotic, off-kilter techno vibrations, this lineup is primed to captivate. Iconic Berlin-based innovator Skee Mask will deliver his signature blend of atmospheric techno and break-heavy grooves, while Phase Fatale’s industrial, EBM-infused sets promise darker, immersive textures. For those craving something sleek and refined, Matrixxman’s razor-sharp Detroit-influenced techno and Luca Olivotto’s warm, house-driven rhythms bring depth and contrast. Finally, the incandescent Only Fire, known for melding pop culture references with leftfield club beats, rounds out a program as diverse and dynamic as the audience it proudly celebrates. This is a true sonic odyssey, unfolding in an inclusive space where everyone can dance into 2025 together.\n\nO Floor decorations by: @ashhigginson\n\nWe strive to provide a safe & worry-free space.\nPlease respect everyone's identity, act with consent and care.\nDiscriminatory behaviour of any kind will not be tolerated.\nPlease respect our no photo/video policy.\n\nRe-entry is €5 and only applicable once (no matter how many times you re-enter). \n\nPlease note that having a ticket doesn't guarantee entry. \nIf you are refused entry for any reason, your ticket will be refunded. \nNo refunds will be given if you can't make it, change your mind or if you do not want to wait in line.",

Musikwünsche gibt es nicht, oder kosten 5 Euro – wenn sie gefallen und ins Set passen“. \nDie sind auch gar nicht nötig: Resident DJ MissVergnügen bedient ein eklektisches musikalisches Spektrum, das von 20er-Jahre-Musik bis hin zu Elektro reicht und dessen Bandbreite wie auch Auswahl gar keine Wünsche offenlassen kann. \nDahinter steht auch die klare Ansage, dass es die Künstlerin nur langweilen würde, bei einer Sache hängen zu bleiben – ziemlich naheliegend bei ihrem facettenreichen Talent als Musikerin, DJ und Sängerin ... Mittwochabend mit MissVergnügen heißt schließlich auch, sich von ihr abholen lassen, in welche Richtung es auch immer geht und dann treiben lassen! Also: Vergnügliches Neues Jahr!\n",

Deep down into the realms of house & techno, he created the Ausblick imprint: Endorsed by massive remixes from Losoul or Steve O'Sullivan, while at the same time pushing forward breakthrough artists, Ausblick proves to be a bold outpost for the minimal house scene. \nBesides producing, djing and label running, Anthony is simply one hell of a fuckin great dude to spend time with - so brace yourself, 2025 will start with a tsunami of good vibes.\n\nmaniac&me will certainly be joining the march shooting minimal and house (vinyl-only) tracks, but is known to shift up a technoid gear or two in the morning hours.\n\nDuma, The Collective stands strong with the Minimal Bar values:\n No Racism. No Sexism. No Homophobia. No Transphobia. No Discrimination of any kind.\n\n",

    "information": "⬤ ABOUT PARADISE GARAGE ⬤\nWe believe that great musical traditions should never die. Our Paradise Garage party series is a tribute to the legendary New Yorker Paradise Garage club that was the place where House music and Disco bloomed between 1976 and the time of its closure in 1987.\n\nOur Paradise Garage remains 100% loyal to the musical tradition of the New Yorker club and his legendary resident Larry Levan. You will not hear Techno, or any of the common modern interpretations of House music and Disco at the party.\n\nOur Paradise Garage is also defined as a sex-positive party. It requires a dress code (read below), and is a safe space for kinky communities and LGTBQ, escorted by a professional and devoted awareness team.\n\nThe dress code is meant to emphasize the border between the everyday and the space we create. We wish to encourage our guests to safely express themselves through fashion and their individual choices of clothes and accessories.\n\n\n⬤ WHAT TO EXPECT ⬤\n⊛ A musical homage to Paradise Garage: classic House and old-school Disco.\n⊛ No streetwear! Come colorful, kinky and creative.\n⊛ Secret DJ lineup.\n⊛ Performances and walking acts.\n⊛ Hedonistic space for kinksters.\n⊛ 4 dance floors and several play rooms.\n⊛ Awareness team.\n\n⬤ MUST READ ⬤\n⊛ The Paradise Garage has a strict no-photo policy. We have a designated photobooth with our photographer, where photos can be taken of those who wish for it.\n⊛ The Paradise Garage is a safe space for any ethnicity, gender or sexual orientation. Any sign of racism, antisemitism, sexism or homophobia will not be tolerated.\n⊛ In addition, you are to respect the personal space of any fellow dancer. In case you feel that you have been treated wrongly, or that your space has been violated, please notify our awareness team or our staff.\n⊛ DRESS-CODE: * Swimsuits * Costumes * Leather * Latex * Naked * Super Heroes * Lingerie * Colorful Festival Style.\nNO CASUAL STREET WEAR SUCH AS JEANS IS ALLOWED.\n\n\n⬤⬤\n\n\n⬤ ÜBER PARADISE GARAGE ⬤\nWir glauben, dass große musikalische Traditionen niemals sterben sollten. Unsere Paradise Garage-Partyreihe ist eine Hommage an den legendären New Yorker Club Paradise Garage, in dem zwischen 1976 und seiner Schließung 1987 die House- und Disco-Musik blühte.\n\nUnsere Paradise Garage bleibt der musikalischen Tradition des New Yorker Clubs und seines legendären Residents Larry Levan zu 100% treu. Du wirst auf der Party weder Techno noch eine der gängigen modernen Interpretationen von House und Disco hören.\n\nUnsere Paradise Garage ist auch als sex-positive Party definiert. Sie erfordert einen Dresscode (siehe unten) und ist ein sicherer Ort für kinky Communities und LGTBQ, der von einem professionellen und engagierten Awareness-Team begleitet wird.\n\nDer Dresscode soll die Grenze zwischen dem Alltag und dem Raum, den wir schaffen, betonen. Wir möchten unsere Gäste dazu ermutigen, sich sicher durch Mode und ihre individuelle Wahl von Kleidung und Accessoires auszudrücken.\n\n\n⬤ WAS DICH ERWARTET ⬤\n⊛ Eine musikalische Hommage an Paradise Garage: klassischer House und Disco der alten Schule.\n⊛ Keine Straßenkleidung! Komm bunt, kinky und kreativ.\n⊛ Geheimes DJ Lineup.\n⊛ Performances und Walking Acts.\n⊛ Hedonistischer Raum für Kinksters.\n⊛ 4 Tanzflächen und mehrere Spielräume.\n⊛ Awareness-Team.\n\n⬤ MUST READ ⬤\n⊛ Bei der Paradise Garage gilt ein striktes Fotoverbot. Wir haben einen Photobooth mit unserer Fotografin, wo Fotos von denjenigen gemacht werden können, die es wünschen.\n⊛ Die Paradise Garage ist ein sicherer Ort für jede Ethnie, jedes Geschlecht und jede sexuelle Orientierung. Jegliche Anzeichen von Rassismus, Antisemitismus, Sexismus oder Homophobie werden nicht toleriert.\n⊛ Darüber hinaus musst du den persönlichen Raum eines jeden Mittänzers respektieren. Solltest du das Gefühl haben, dass du ungerecht behandelt oder dein Freiraum verletzt wurde, melde dies bitte unserem Awareness-Team oder unseren Mitarbeitern.\n⊛ DRESS-CODE: * Badeanzüge * Kostüme * Leder * Latex * Nackt * Superhelden * Dessous * Bunter Festival-Stil.\nKEINE LEGERE STRASSENKLEIDUNG WIE JEANS IST ERLAUBT.\n\n⬤⬤\n\nAreas open: Pool, Main Floor, Dragon Floor, Prisma Bar, Sépareé.",

Deep down into the realms of house & techno, he created the Ausblick imprint: Endorsed by massive remixes from Losoul or Steve O'Sullivan, while at the same time pushing forward breakthrough artists, Ausblick proves to be a bold outpost for the minimal house scene. \nBesides producing, djing and label running, Anthony is simply one hell of a fuckin great dude to spend time with - so brace yourself, 2025 will start with a tsunami of good vibes.\n\nmaniac&me will certainly be joining the march shooting minimal and house (vinyl-only) tracks, but is known to shift up a technoid gear or two in the morning hours.\n\nDuma, The Collective stands strong with the Minimal Bar values:\n No Racism. No Sexism. No Homophobia. No Transphobia. No Discrimination of any kind.\n\n",

They have developed a dedicated underground following, drawing influence from bands like Suicide, D.A.F, and the UK electronic scene. Renowned for their dark atmospheres and captivating melodies, the group blends elements of electronic music and post-punk. Their lyrics often delve into themes of introspection and human relationships, often with a hint of irony. With energetic live performances and a talent for reinvention, they have built a loyal fanbase. ",

    "information": "Welcome to Dorothy’s Friend – the End of the Parties-Party! The weekend is here, and after the whirlwind of Christmas celebrations and New Year’s festivities, it’s time to party yet again! Yes, we’re keeping the energy alive and giving the holiday season the grand send-off it deserves with one last unforgettable night. It’s the long weekend, the first Friday of the year, and the perfect moment to gather your friends, hit the dance floor, and let loose before the routines of everyday life return.\nThis time, we’re embracing the after-the-parties vibe – think rumpled Santas, disheveled elves, and 2025 party hats and glasses that have clearly survived one too many celebrations. The decorations may be frayed (and so could you), but the energy is far from gone!\nThe name Friends of Dorothy holds a cherished place in queer history. Originating as a subtle code used by LGBTQ+ individuals to connect during times of adversity, it symbolizes solidarity, safe spaces, and the enduring bonds of friendship. Inspired by Dorothy from The Wizard of Oz, whose journey celebrated courage and camaraderie, we come together to honor those same values in our vibrant, inclusive way.\nThis special January edition is a toast to the end of the holiday frenzy and the start of a new chapter. Whether you’re looking to dance off the last remnants of New Year’s indulgence, reconnect with friends, or simply revel in the moment, this party is yours to make unforgettable.\nAs your DJ, I’ll be curating a set that reflects the diversity and energy of our community. Expect a blend of house, disco, and eclectic sounds designed to keep you moving, mingling, and immersed in the moment. Whether you’re sipping on cocktails, sharing laughs, or losing yourself on the dance floor, the music will weave its magic to create the perfect vibe for the night.\n\nDJ: Feel. MA\nRaised in a small village in Northern Italy, Feel. MA found refuge in music, shaped by the eclectic tastes of his parents. The vibrant club scene introduced him to the world of electronic and dance music, setting him on a path of passion and discovery.\nInfluenced by Italian producers and the London warehouse movement, Feel. MA crafts a soundscape that fuses house, electro, and disco. Now based in Berlin, he’s become a staple in iconic venues like Chantal House of Shame and KitKat club, captivating audiences with his long sets and dynamic energy.\nFeel. MA’s mission is simple: to reignite the passion of house and disco music and guide listeners on a journey of self-expression and unity through uplifting beats and positive vibes that transcend boundaries and languages.\n",

    "information": "Der erste Samstag im neuen Jahr ist keine normale Klubnacht, sondern eine Live From Earth Klub Party im Berghain. Basspunk ist der Name des Debütalbums des Londoner Duos Bassvictim und kann auch als Genrebezeichnung für ihren Indie-Sleaze-Sound gelten, der eine Mischung aus Grunge und Rap-Rock-Synthie-Pop ist. Der zweite Live-Act ist das Hamburger Duo Extrawelt, das 2005 auf James Holdens Border Community debütierte und seitdem mit acidlastigen Acid-Trance-Bangern und brustbetontem Electro überzeugt. Chippy Nonstop ist eine in Kanada lebende DJ und Gründerin des Kollektivs Intersessions, das Frauen und nicht-binären Menschen das Auflegen beibringt. In ihrem Sound verschmelzen harter Techno, Jungle und Footwork zu einem funky Uptempo-Groove. Auch in den Sets von DJ Vanille aus Marseille prallen musikalische Welten aufeinander, die von geradlinigem Techno über Acid House bis hin zu Hard-Dance, Trance und Psy-Trance reichen. Freuen kann man sich auch auf ein Wiedersehen mit Modeselektor, die nach vielen Jahren wieder ein DJ-Set im Berghain spielen werden.\n\nOn the first Saturday of the New Year, instead of the usual Klubnacht, Live From Earth Klub will take over Berghain. Basspunk is the debut album by London duo Bassvictim, its title also serving as a genre description for their sleazy indie sound, mixing grunge, rap-rock and synth-pop. Also performing a live set is Hamburg duo Extrawelt, who have been impressing audiences ever since their debut on James Holden's Border Community in 2005, offering acid-heavy acid trance bangers and chest-thumping electro. Chippy Nonstop is a Canadian-based DJ and founder of the Intersessions collective, which teaches women and non-binary people how to DJ. Her sound fuses hard techno, jungle and footwork into a funky uptempo groove. Musical worlds also collide in the sets of DJ Vanille from Marseille, ranging from straightforward techno and acid house to hard dance, trance and psy-trance. You can also look forward to Modeselektor, returning to Berghain for the first time in years with a DJ set.",
