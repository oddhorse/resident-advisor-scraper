    "information": "3… 2… 1… Ladiez Drink Free unifies the individual talent of Brooklyn bombshells: Perna, MARI, and Drupe Jam. In addition to incorporating the erotic component of old school rave flyers into the contemporary dance world, this trio has nailed the singular sound of club euphoria. They ring in the new year with a nasty, tour-de-force four-hour set.\n\nAfter his BBC Essential Mix, DJ Python continually explores the art of multi-genre and is no stranger to milestone heights. The power of his artistry, however, lies in the gentle moments and subtle fluctuations he laces within extended sets.\n\nEamon Harkin and Justin Carter are stalwart veteran DJs of the New York scene, having cut their teeth in the warehouse and loft parties of the early aughts, founding the Mister Saturday Night and Mister Sunday parties in 2009 and eventually opening Nowadays. They've been residents on NTS and The Lot and toured on six continents, but they are always most at home in the booth they built. Whether they're playing from the chuggy and hypnotic corners of their record bags or the joyous and deep, they'll soundtrack the dance to welcome New Year's Day perfectly. \n\nFollowing Eamon and Justin, CZ Wang and Regularfantasy team up at noon for cheeky bangers on cheeky bangers. CZ is usually found in Brooklyn watering holes as a DJ or emcee. His professional ear has been tuned through his work as a sound engineer, making him the perfect accomplice for this back to back with one of Canada’s most beloved vocal house selectors.\n \nBefore Jacob Meehan started producing, he was already ingrained into the circuit of queer collectives, festivals, and parties — WHOLE Festival, BUTTONS, CockTail d’Amore, and Club Toilet to name a few. From Chicago to Berlin, his selections revel in the power of sensual gratification. \n\nJADALAREIGN & Mike Servito take over for a venture into various dancefloor disciplines. Their collective sound keeps things hot before Carlos Souffront takes over. With ties to prolific Detroit-based labels and parties such as Interdimensional Transmissions and No Way Back, his long standing radio show, Crush Collision, is easily overlooked. Such accomplishments come secondary for Carlos, who cites context and character as most important. He responds to dance floor shifts with energizing micro-genres and masterful selections from his lifelong collection of crate gold. We follow his lead and let the music speak for itself.\n\n22:00 - 02:00 Ladiez Drink Free\n02:00 - 06:00 DJ Python\n06:00 - 12:00 Eamon Harkin & Justin Carter\n12:00 - 16:00 CZ Wang & Regularfantasy\n16:00 - 19:00 Jacob Meehan\n19:00 - 23:00 JADALAREIGN & Mike Servito\n23:00 - close Carlos Souffront\n\n///\n\nEntry is at the discretion of our door staff. Online purchases are limited to four tickets maximum per person. If tickets are sold out here, we always hold a good amount at the door. We will do our best to admit those without tickets but entrance is not guaranteed.\n\nNonstop tickets are divided by entry time. You must arrive during the hours listed on your ticket. For example, if you buy a \"10PM–4AM\" ticket, you must get here between 10pm and 4am.\n\nAfter you've arrived during your designated time window, you can stay as long as you'd like, so long as you abide by our safer space policy (more on that below). You're also welcome to come and go as you please. Re-entry is based on capacity and is not guaranteed.\n\nNonstop attendees can attend Mister Sunday in the backyard starting at 3 pm without buying a separate ticket, and Nonstop re-entry is honored during Mister Sunday.\n\nViolence, non-consensual touching, racist, homophobic, transphobic, sexist, ageist or other discriminatory language, and leering are not allowed within our walls or in our back yard. If someone says or does something to make you feel uncomfortable while you’re here, let us know.",

No doubt influenced by the bass music of his Miami homeland, he is very much part of a fresh and exciting crew of producers making bootylicious house music with ghetto rawness, percolating percussions and firing vocals that always send crowds wild.  \n\nHis latest effort, \"Fake\" on his own Mr Nice Guy Records is a big rubber banger with rapped vocals, dirty drums and the sort of attitude that will have dancers in raptures. Before now he has released on essential labels like Hot Creations, I’m A House Gangster, BPitch Control and Eats Everything’s Edible and his music always has a tongue in cheek charm and real sense of humor. It swings and is funky, touches on hip house and often comes stuffed with skewed synths that never fail to make their mark. Certainly one of the most prominent artists in the game right now, his bump and grind sounds are in demand all over the world, and for good reason.",

    "information": "A leading figure in the modern jungle revival, London's Tim Reaper is a nearly impossible artist to miss. His explosive productions and DJ sets have stretched drum + bass to new limits worldwide, with rapid breakbeats and teeth-rattling low end frequencies pushing the genre and its dancers further and further on the hardcore continuum. Prepare for nonstop shakers with Reaper all night long in The Sound Room.\n\nMia Koden, formerly of Sicaria Sound, makes her long-awaited solo debut at Public Records. After her standout self-release \"Hot Take / I did\" followed by \"Decode\" on Ilian Tape, her dub- and system-shaking take on bass music has spread like a wildfire. The South Sudanese / British DJ and producer joins Brooklyn's Sister Zo for a harmonious night of 2-step, UK bass, broken beat, and dubstep in The Atrium.\n\nUPSTAIRS, Russell E.L. Butler shares a metaphysical taste of minimal synth, electronic body music, and stripped-back house. Their productions have been featured by DJ Mag, T4T LUV NRG, Tresor.\n\nPublic Records aims to provide a safer space. We reject all forms of discrimination, including racism, misogyny, transphobia, homophobia, sexism, and other aggressive behavior. Consent is paramount. Please exist with respect for yourself and those around you. Anyone found in violation of our rules or safer space policy will be removed from the venue.\n\nTo share feedback about an incident, please email hello@publicrecords.nyc or alert a member of our team.\n\nLimited tickets will be sold at the door. A ticket does not guarantee entry. Admission into the venue is subject to capacity and the discretion of our staff.",

His sets are known for their unpredictable twists and turns, expertly navigating through deep cuts, rare gems, and cutting-edge productions that challenge conventions and push the boundaries of electronic music.\n\nIn both his DJing and his production (with releases on Gigolo, Relief, Muzique, M/O/S, and Crème), Traxx is committed to analog approaches over digital smoothness, DJing vinyl and producing with hardware. His sound recalls the past but pushes for the future with an overtly emotional and experimental approach.\n\nWhether you're a long-time fan or a newcomer to his unique style, this all-night extended set is a rare opportunity to witness one of the most influential figures in the scene delivering his signature sound with plenty of space to stretch out.\n\n///\n\nEntry is at the discretion of our door staff. Online purchases are limited to four tickets maximum per person. If tickets are sold out here, we always hold a good amount at the door. We will do our best to admit those without tickets but entrance is not guaranteed.\n\nViolence, non-consensual touching, racist, homophobic, transphobic, sexist, ageist or other discriminatory language, and leering are not allowed within our walls or in our back yard.

    "information": "\"Chicago, Chicago, that toddlin’ town…\"\n-Frank Sinatra\n\n\"Lake Shore Drive is the fastest street in America\"\n- Connor O'Malley\n\n︵‿︵‿︵＼ʕ •ᴥ•ʔ／︵‿︵‿︵\nA monthly party from America’s wackiest rave record label Sorry Records\n\nWe’re back at Bossa for our first party of the new year with a very special Tony G Takeover featuring a lineup of the finest disc jockeys with roots in his new home of Chicago for what is sure to be a cute and funky night. Proud to present two Bossa debuts from Club Chow and Pacer, as well as a deeply appreciated b2b reunion from Tony G and Nick Boyd (me).\n\nTossing it to Tony here — \n\nI first met Kevin Chow when we all pooled our money to buy and rip a copy of the double 12” of Duran Duran’s cover of ‘White Lines’ (impossible to pick a favorite of the 8 mixes but the Sound Factory Dub 2 goes crazy!) - but I’d been aware of Club Chow for much longer than that. A staple of the queer underground on dance floors and in DJ booths alike, Kevin is known far and wide as an energetic mixer, tireless promoter, and an extremely savvy dresser. He has held down residencies at Chicago’s Steamworks Baths and Dim Sum & Drag, curates the leftfield rager Club Gauche and queer day function Forbidden Fruitz, and is a regular at queer parties across Chicago. Kevin’s stock is booming after his recent Hot Mass debut and we’re thrilled to host him for a peak time Sunday night set at Bossa. \n\nChicago lost a real one when Pacer moved to New York last year. Perhaps best known as one half of the DJ duo Dasani Boys with his brother Akeem, Ahmad Asani is a force behind the decks on his own, evidenced by his fantastic ‘Pacer Test’ radio residency on Chicago’s Beloved Radio (highly recommend a deep dive!) as well as past live engagements opening for the likes of Galcher Lustwerk, Charli XCX, and Virgil Abloh. I love Pacer’s ability to balance deep and meditative cuts with party rockers, a perfect formula for opening up the night at Bossa. \n\nLastly, we’ll close the night out with a joyous b2b reunion set from our founders Nick Boyd and Tony G. If you’re reading this, you probably know us - two dedicated DJs, dancers, and music lovers. We’ve only done a few public b2bs over the year, most notably at Bossa on Halloween 2022 and at my old Giambrone & Co party at Mansions. We’re always looking to throw each other and the audience some curveballs, so expect a bit of late night soup to close things out.\n\nParty runs 10pm to 4am and is free before 11pm, $10 after.\n\n╔╗╔╗╔═╦╦╦═╗╔══╦╦╦═╦╦═╗\n║║║║║║║║║╚╣║║║║║║╚╣║╔╝\n║║║╚╣║║║║╔╣║║║║║╠╗║║╚╗\n╚╝╚═╩═╩═╩═╝╚╩╩╩═╩═╩╩═╝\n\n\"One of the underground’s best dance labels\"\n- No Tags Podcast, on Sorry Records\n\n\"Loveable, Hard Working, Absolutely Rowdy Party Starters, Speaker Freaks... yea I dunno, what more can you say about Sorry Records? One of New York's hardest working crews, and a bottomless well of support for the city's scene.\"\n- Sweat Equity\n\n“Since its foundation in 2015, Sorry Records has become a critical outpost in New York’s dance-music scene. The label balances an unwavering commitment to the city’s dance-music history with a dead-serious approach to having a good time. Their best material seems like it could have come out in the ‘90s, were it not for the of-the-moment production techniques and references in the liner notes.”\n- Michael McKinney, Passion of the Weiss\n\n⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⣠⣶⣶⣶⣦⠀⠀\n⠀⠀⣠⣤⣤⣄⣀⣾⣿⠟⠛⠻⢿⣷⠀\n⢰⣿⡿⠛⠙⠻⣿⣿⠁⠀⠀ ⠀⣶⢿⡇\n⢿⣿⣇⠀⠀⠀⠈⠏⠀⠀⠀ dance music\n⠀⠻⣿⣷⣦⣤⣀⠀⠀⠀ ⠀⣾⡿⠃⠀\n⠀⠀⠀⠀⠉⠉⠻⣿⣄⣴⣿⠟⠀⠀⠀\n⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⣿⡿⠟⠁⠀⠀⠀\n\n⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⣀⡀⠤⠒⠀⠐⠢⠤⠀⡀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀\n⠀⠀⠀⡐⠈⠉⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠈⡇⠀⠀⠀⠀\n⠀⠀⠀⡇⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⣀⣀⣀⠀⠀⠀⢰⠀⠀⠀⠀\n⠀⠀⠀⡇⠀⠀⠀⠀⠬⠭⠕⡒⠀⠀⠀⠀⠈⡆⢠⠗⠄\n⢰⢢⢸⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠉⠉⠉⠀⠀⣀⣀⣀⡀⠁⡌⠀⢸\n⢸⠀⠇⠠⢖⣺⣍⠡⠶⠀⠀⠙⠍⣸⡂⠰⠃⠀⢀⠔⠁\n⠀⢱⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠇⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠃⠀\n⠀⢸⣀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⢀⠇⠀⠘⡄⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⢀⣘⡀\n⠀⠀⠀⡆⠀⠀⠀⠀⡘⠀⠀⠀⢰⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⡇⠁⠀\n⠀⠀⠀⡇⠀⠀⠀⠀⠧⠖⠖⠒⠒⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀\n⠀⠀⠀⡇⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⢀⢰⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⢀⠀⠀\n⠀⠀⠸⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⢀⣈⣀⠀⠤⣄⡀⠀⠀⠀⠘⠀⠀\n⠀⠀⠀⢇⠀⠀⠀⢶⠮⢖⣓⠸⠽⠛⠃⠀⠀⡰⠃⠀⠀\n⠀⠀⠀⠀⠑⠄⣀⣈⣉⣁⢀⠀⡀⢠⠤⠒⠉⠀⠀⠀⠀\n⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠈⠊⠉⠈⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀\n",
