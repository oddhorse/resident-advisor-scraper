As Speaker Music, he channels the African American modernist tradition of rhythm and soul music as an intellectual site and sound of techno-vernacular expression. He has released three albums on Planet Mu: of desire, longing (2019), Black Nationalist Sonic Weaponry (2020), and Techxodus (2023). His written work explores the links between the Black experience in industrialized labor systems and Black innovation in electronic music. Brown’s debut book, Assembling a Black Counter Culture, was released on Primary Information in 2022. In 2023, he co-curated HOPE, an international group exhibition presented by Museion Museum of Modern and Contemporary Art in Bolzano-Bozen, Italy, as the final installment of the TECHNO HUMANITIES trilogy. Brown is currently collaborating with the techno originator, Juan Atkins, and Berlin Club/record label, Tresor, on the meta-narratives for Cybotron’s Maintain the Golden Ratio (2023), Parallel Shift (2024), and beyond.\n‍\nFor online tickets, please go to The Supermarket ATL's website.",

With our custom-tuned Altec A7 Voice of the Theatre sound system, we’re ready to deliver an immersive experience that celebrates music as a storytelling medium, connecting dancers and music lovers alike.\n\nWe’re thrilled to welcome two special guests:\n\nVince Lin, a hi-fi fanatic and true vinyl connoisseur, will be lending us his Condesa rotary mixer to captain the dancefloor’s sonic journey. Known as one of Atlanta’s \"if you know, you know\" selectors, Vince has a passion for obscure, deep sounds that resonate with those who appreciate music as an art form. His approach is simple yet powerful: let the music do the talking.\n\nAlongside Vince is Playr1, an enigmatic character in the scene and a Mood to Move and Desires resident, who’s been carving his path with a personality that is as expressive as his selections. He’s earned his stripes through sheer passion and authenticity, bringing a curious and adventurous spirit to the decks. Player1 is someone who truly walks the walk, delivering deeply personal sets that reflect his desire to connect through sound.\n\nJoining them are Bloom residents Titino and TJ Coito, who bring their own distinctive voices and explorative selections, always pushing boundaries to create meaningful dancefloor moments.\n\nMusically, the night will take dancers on a genre-bending journey through electro, techno, house, Italo, EBM, and deep obscure grooves. Expect forward-thinking selections and storytelling through sound, with each DJ crafting sets that highlight their unique perspectives and personal narratives.\n\nAt Bloom, we aim to cultivate a space where expression, connection, and experimentation thrive. A night for the unseen, the unheard, and those who know.\n\n Tickets available at the door or online via Shotgun.\n\nFriday, January 19th\n10 PM → Late | 21+\n420 Beer Garden | 420 Edgewood Ave",

    "information": "Although he hails from the south of France, Dombresky’s penchant for invigorating four- on-the-floor beats is pure house bliss. The DJ and producer burst onto the scene in 2016 when he arrived in Miami as Quentin Dombres, a then-unknown talent with an impressive roster of funky, feel-good tracks. Today he has become inextricably linked with industry heavyweights including Blondish, Armand van Helden, Diplo, Claptone, and MK, all of whom supported Dombresky’s early career endeavors as collaborators. With jazz-tinged, hypnotic songs like “Soul Sacrifice” earning over 50 million streams and counting, and becoming one of Beatport’s top selling artists, it’s clear that Dombresky has set himself apart from the rest. Just a few years after arriving in the States and starting his career from scratch, Dombresky has hit career milestones that most DJs only dream of, playing Lollapalooza, headlining Snowglobe and Countdown NYE, selling out famous venues including the Shrine Auditorium and the Hollywood Palladium, and growing a loyal fanbase that nets him millions of streams per month.\n\nNow, Dombresky has gone global, playing sold-out venues across the country, to the hottest clubs of Ibiza and Dubai, and he shows no signs of slowing down. In 2023 he is slated to return to Coachella and continues to broadcast his passion project, Process Radio, which won him an Electronic Dance Music Award for best radio show. He isn’t just stopping there. Expanding the Process name, Dombresky is thrilled to launch Process Records, which will allow him to take ownership of his masters and mentor up- and-coming talents.\n\n\n\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\nLots of FREE Parking\n\nCome as you are and we will make memories together\n\nLimited amount of tickets available.\n\nThere is plenty of free parking along the street if you arrive early, but we suggest Uber & Lyft if you're planning to have a drink.\n\nwww.liquified.com\n\nwww.districtatlanta.com\n\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\n**By purchasing a ticket and entering this event, you consent to your voice and/or likeness being used, without compensation, in video or photo format for the use on digital media platforms and materials, and you release District Atlanta, its successors, assigns, and licensees from any liability whatsoever of any nature.",

Born and raised in New York, Kwarteng’s name has recently risen in prominence throughout a challenging time for dance music and club culture. A DJ, radio host and curator, her sets have recently enchanted Panorama Bar in Berlin (four times in less than twelve months, no less), equally vital club spaces such as NYC’s Nowadays and Amsterdam’s own De School, as well as a span of festivals including Glastonbury, Horst, Melt and Dekmantel Selectors. \n\nListening to Kwarteng, whether in a cavernous rave hall, a sweat-soaked underground club or making intimate selections on the radio, is an experience that feels at once familiar but always energizing. Kwarteng’s diverse taste and open-mindedness lead first, allowing her to fluidly slip through a mix of heady 80s and 90s NY House, disco interpretations that traverse diaspora and eras, percussive passages alongside boldly broken beats and, as the lights get lower, an undeniable acid undercurrent. In an era of everything at once, Kwarteng weaves stories for the dancefloor that often look to the past, but always focus on possible futures.",

Iranian by birth, Canadian by upbringing, these two have come a long way from their own journeys before reuniting in Berlin.\n\nWhat we know is that their deeply rooted love for electronic music led them to storm Vancouver's nightlife as DJs since 2011. This in turn prepared them to start their experimentation with making music that pulls influences from their hyphenated backgrounds. Today they embody a sound capturing their subtle lust for soulful elements coupled with their itch for meaningful grooves.\nTheir music has already taken them to perform numerous times in legendary gatherings such as, OFFSónar in Barcelona, Art Basel in Miami, Acidcase x Mayan Warrior in Berlin, Katerblau in Berlin, Woomoon in Ibiza and Garbicz Festival in Poland.\n\nThey continue to nurture their sound in Berlin with releases on labels such as Get Physical, Kindisch, Moodfamily, Kiosk I.D, and soon to be Nervous Records.",

Our own resident DJ Silk Wolf even produced a banging remix of their track “Fate Awaits”!\n\nNow they’re making their Atlanta debut as part of the second half of their North American tour and we’re so damn fortunate to be the ones to host them! So here’s your chance to finally hear their dark, seedy, and sexy sound LIVE, LOUD, and PERSONAL! \n\nSupporting Die Sexual is Asheville’s very own Cold Choir, and we’ve been eager to get these two here ever since they played with us at our first live show event in October! Their poetic lyrics and ferocious sound had us on our toes all night long, so if you missed them last time then here’s your opportunity to see and hear them in all of their glory! \n\nAnd opening for both Die Sexual and Cold Choir is ATL’s own Nixon in China! 1/2 CdV resident DJ, 1/2 coven member, Nixon in China is the new musical project from Blue Max and Bobby Lundy, and this marks their debut live performance! So make sure to come early to catch them starting the night right!\n\nBut it doesn’t end there! Our very own Silk Wolf will be keeping the night going with a late night DJ set immediately after the show! And as always he’ll be bringing all the goth, darkwave, and EBM hits that you’ve come to know and love at our events, so you’re definitely going to want to stay until the very end! We might even have a few surprise guests join him on the CDJs… \n\n\n\nA limited amount of Opening Act tickets are now on sale for the special price of $10 via the link in our bio for our vamps who want to arrive on time to show Nixon in China love and support! Early Bat tickets are also on sale for the standard price of $15, and tickets will also be sold at the door for $20 on the night of the event!\n\nSee you on Saturday, February 15th, vamps! \n\n\nDoors open at 9PM, event starts at 10PM\n\nRide-sharing is encouraged!
