Come early, stay forever!

Glide into 2025 and celebrate new beginnings and good riddance!

Bask in the dawn of the new year through immersive techno, soulful house, and that signature OXI touch. We've got a divine mix of very special guests and the finest local talent. 
If our heated garden is not enough for you to wind down, we've got a tranquil Ambient Floor, a tasty Chili Soup Bar and a toasty Glühwein on tap!

Ring in the new year at OXI’s 36-hour marathon, a boundary-pushing celebration catering to the city’s vibrant creative community. From the UK’s Yazzus—renowned for her high-octane rave aesthetics, breakbeats, and forward-thinking club sounds—to the experimental selections of SPFDJ and Spekki Webu, who each channel hypnotic, off-kilter techno vibrations, this lineup is primed to captivate. Iconic Berlin-based innovator Skee Mask will deliver his signature blend of atmospheric techno and break-heavy grooves, while Phase Fatale’s industrial, EBM-infused sets promise darker, immersive textures. For those craving something sleek and refined, Matrixxman’s razor-sharp Detroit-influenced techno and Luca Olivotto’s warm, house-driven rhythms bring depth and contrast. Finally, the incandescent Only Fire, known for melding pop culture references with leftfield club beats, rounds out a program as diverse and dynamic as the audience it proudly celebrates. This is a true sonic odyssey, unfolding in an inclusive space where everyone can dance into 2025 together.

However, we regret to inform you that the December 31st night at SEZ has been CANCELLED due to unforeseen legal issues with the venue.

What happened to Pyramid Party New Year at SEZ?
There’s a legal dispute over the venue. Green Yoga has stayed in the space, backed by lawyers and architects opposing the SEZ’s demolition. In the past days however, the property manager for the Berlin Government changed the locks and shut off electricity and water—despite a court order. Unfortunately, we’ve now been told we can’t return until January 14.
We’re truly sorry for the inconvenience and worked hard with a large team to try to make it happen.

INSTEAD WE HAVE THE CHANCE TO CELEBRATE THE NEW YEAR AT STUDIO DB ON THE 1ST OF JANUARY FROM 4PM-4AM. 

A venue with heating and sauna.
Limited to 150 or so people.

maniac&me will have the exceptional talent Anthony Georges Patrice (aka AGP) joining him on this first Thursday 2025:
Anthony's taste oscillates between Dubtechno, Deep House and Minimal tunes, aiming to never really stick to a genre to maximize the listener's voyage. Deep down into the realms of house & techno, he created the Ausblick imprint: Endorsed by massive remixes from Losoul or Steve O'Sullivan, while at the same time pushing forward breakthrough artists, Ausblick proves to be a bold outpost for the minimal house scene. 
Besides producing, djing and label running, Anthony is simply one hell of a fuckin great dude to spend time with - so brace yourself, 2025 will start with a tsunami of good vibes.

maniac&me will certainly be joining the march shooting minimal and house (vinyl-only) tracks, but is known to shift up a technoid gear or two in the morning hours.

 No Racism. No Sexism. No Homophobia. No Transphobia. No Discrimination of any kind.

We believe that great musical traditions should never die. Our Paradise Garage party series is a tribute to the legendary New Yorker Paradise Garage club that was the place where House music and Disco bloomed between 1976 and the time of its closure in 1987.

Our Paradise Garage remains 100% loyal to the musical tradition of the New Yorker club and his legendary resident Larry Levan. You will not hear Techno, or any of the common modern interpretations of House music and Disco at the party.

Our Paradise Garage is also defined as a sex-positive party. It requires a dress code (read below), and is a safe space for kinky communities and LGTBQ, escorted by a professional and devoted awareness team.

The dress code is meant to emphasize the border between the everyday and the space we create. We wish to encourage our guests to safely express themselves through fashion and their individual choices of clothes and accessories.

⬤ ÜBER PARADISE GARAGE ⬤
Wir glauben, dass große musikalische Traditionen niemals sterben sollten. Unsere Paradise Garage-Partyreihe ist eine Hommage an den legendären New Yorker Club Paradise Garage, in dem zwischen 1976 und seiner Schließung 1987 die House- und Disco-Musik blühte.

Unsere Paradise Garage bleibt der musikalischen Tradition des New Yorker Clubs und seines legendären Residents Larry Levan zu 100% treu. Du wirst auf der Party weder Techno noch eine der gängigen modernen Interpretationen von House und Disco hören.

Unsere Paradise Garage ist auch als sex-positive Party definiert. Sie erfordert einen Dresscode (siehe unten) und ist ein sicherer Ort für kinky Communities und LGTBQ, der von einem professionellen und engagierten Awareness-Team begleitet wird.

Der Dresscode soll die Grenze zwischen dem Alltag und dem Raum, den wir schaffen, betonen. Wir möchten unsere Gäste dazu ermutigen, sich sicher durch Mode und ihre individuelle Wahl von Kleidung und Accessoires auszudrücken.

maniac&me will have the exceptional talent Anthony Georges Patrice (aka AGP) joining him on this first Thursday 2025:
Anthony's taste oscillates between Dubtechno, Deep House and Minimal tunes, aiming to never really stick to a genre to maximize the listener's voyage. Deep down into the realms of house & techno, he created the Ausblick imprint: Endorsed by massive remixes from Losoul or Steve O'Sullivan, while at the same time pushing forward breakthrough artists, Ausblick proves to be a bold outpost for the minimal house scene. 
Besides producing, djing and label running, Anthony is simply one hell of a fuckin great dude to spend time with - so brace yourself, 2025 will start with a tsunami of good vibes.

maniac&me will certainly be joining the march shooting minimal and house (vinyl-only) tracks, but is known to shift up a technoid gear or two in the morning hours.

 No Racism. No Sexism. No Homophobia. No Transphobia. No Discrimination of any kind.

Absolute Body Control is a cult Belgian electronic band formed in 1979, notable as the first major project of musicians Dirk Ivens and Eric Van Wonterghem. They have developed a dedicated underground following, drawing influence from bands like Suicide, D.A.F, and the UK electronic scene. Renowned for their dark atmospheres and captivating melodies, the group blends elements of electronic music and post-punk. Their lyrics often delve into themes of introspection and human relationships, often with a hint of irony. With energetic live performances and a talent for reinvention, they have built a loyal fanbase. ",TIQ,https://absolutebodycontrol.bandcamp.com/

Young Love

For more than a decade, the techno bass has been booming on Fridays, presented by some of the capital's most special DJs, and a young crowd has been flocking to the unholy dance temple when “Young Love” is on the flyer.

A mix of guests that couldn't be more exciting, with sexy freaks, young hoppers, glamorous clubbers and delicious night owls can look forward to a particularly danceable combination this time.

Berlin DJs and national acts are at the turntables and play a sound that can only be experienced at “Young Love”. Sophisticated. Driving. Innovative.

And while the main hall is rocking, adventurous guests can enjoy the BDSM catacombs, the couple's gallery or the jacuzzi. An awareness team is always in the club, ensures your safety and is always approachable.

And all this in a club where all age groups feel comfortable, and also dare to explore new paths of passion or just party wildly - the INSOMNIA.

Even in the often financially difficult times after the pandemic, we want to continue to make all youngsters happy and grant all visitors between the ages of 18 and 25 free admission.

Please present appropriate proof (student ID, social ticket BVG, etc.) at the box office for the social or student ticket.",InsomniaClub,https://www.insomnia-berlin.de

The weekend is here, and after the whirlwind of Christmas celebrations and New Year’s festivities, it’s time to party yet again! Yes, we’re keeping the energy alive and giving the holiday season the grand send-off it deserves with one last unforgettable night. It’s the long weekend, the first Friday of the year, and the perfect moment to gather your friends, hit the dance floor, and let loose before the routines of everyday life return.
This time, we’re embracing the after-the-parties vibe – think rumpled Santas, disheveled elves, and 2025 party hats and glasses that have clearly survived one too many celebrations. The decorations may be frayed (and so could you), but the energy is far from gone!
The name Friends of Dorothy holds a cherished place in queer history. Originating as a subtle code used by LGBTQ+ individuals to connect during times of adversity, it symbolizes solidarity, safe spaces, and the enduring bonds of friendship. Inspired by Dorothy from The Wizard of Oz, whose journey celebrated courage and camaraderie, we come together to honor those same values in our vibrant, inclusive way.
This special January edition is a toast to the end of the holiday frenzy and the start of a new chapter. Whether you’re looking to dance off the last remnants of New Year’s indulgence, reconnect with friends, or simply revel in the moment, this party is yours to make unforgettable.
As your DJ, I’ll be curating a set that reflects the diversity and energy of our community. Expect a blend of house, disco, and eclectic sounds designed to keep you moving, mingling, and immersed in the moment. Whether you’re sipping on cocktails, sharing laughs, or losing yourself on the dance floor, the music will weave its magic to create the perfect vibe for the night.

DJ: Feel. MA
Raised in a small village in Northern Italy, Feel. MA found refuge in music, shaped by the eclectic tastes of his parents. The vibrant club scene introduced him to the world of electronic and dance music, setting him on a path of passion and discovery.
Influenced by Italian producers and the London warehouse movement, Feel. MA crafts a soundscape that fuses house, electro, and disco. Now based in Berlin, he’s become a staple in iconic venues like Chantal House of Shame and KitKat club, captivating audiences with his long sets and dynamic energy.
Feel. MA’s mission is simple: to reignite the passion of house and disco music and guide listeners on a journey of self-expression and unity through uplifting beats and positive vibes that transcend boundaries and languages.

Basspunk ist der Name des Debütalbums des Londoner Duos Bassvictim und kann auch als Genrebezeichnung für ihren Indie-Sleaze-Sound gelten, der eine Mischung aus Grunge und Rap-Rock-Synthie-Pop ist. Der zweite Live-Act ist das Hamburger Duo Extrawelt, das 2005 auf James Holdens Border Community debütierte und seitdem mit acidlastigen Acid-Trance-Bangern und brustbetontem Electro überzeugt. Chippy Nonstop ist eine in Kanada lebende DJ und Gründerin des Kollektivs Intersessions, das Frauen und nicht-binären Menschen das Auflegen beibringt. In ihrem Sound verschmelzen harter Techno, Jungle und Footwork zu einem funky Uptempo-Groove. Auch in den Sets von DJ Vanille aus Marseille prallen musikalische Welten aufeinander, die von geradlinigem Techno über Acid House bis hin zu Hard-Dance, Trance und Psy-Trance reichen. Freuen kann man sich auch auf ein Wiedersehen mit Modeselektor, die nach vielen Jahren wieder ein DJ-Set im Berghain spielen werden.

On the first Saturday of the New Year, instead of the usual Klubnacht, Live From Earth Klub will take over Berghain. Basspunk is the debut album by London duo Bassvictim, its title also serving as a genre description for their sleazy indie sound, mixing grunge, rap-rock and synth-pop. Also performing a live set is Hamburg duo Extrawelt, who have been impressing audiences ever since their debut on James Holden's Border Community in 2005, offering acid-heavy acid trance bangers and chest-thumping electro. Chippy Nonstop is a Canadian-based DJ and founder of the Intersessions collective, which teaches women and non-binary people how to DJ. Her sound fuses hard techno, jungle and footwork into a funky uptempo groove. Musical worlds also collide in the sets of DJ Vanille from Marseille, ranging from straightforward techno and acid house to hard dance, trance and psy-trance. You can also look forward to Modeselektor, returning to Berghain for the first time in years with a DJ set.",Ostgut,https://www.berghain.berlin/de/event/78626/

To kick off the year in high voltaged energy, we're thrilled to announce the first event of 2025 and the first episode of Season 3! This time Parisha has put together an line-up featuring DJs from Leipzig's LPZG CALLIN collective.

They've become a go-to for raw, hypnotic techno and have firmly established themselves as a present player in the city's music culture. With over 25 shows last year alone, it's the support of their growing community that keeps it going.

Starting as a group of friends in Leipzig, LPZG CALLIN has become a steadily growing community, putting their own stamp on the city's underground music scene through their open-air and off-location shows.
